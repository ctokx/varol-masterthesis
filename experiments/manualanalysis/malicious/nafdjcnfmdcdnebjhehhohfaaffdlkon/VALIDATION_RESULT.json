  "reasoning": "The extension is classified as MALICIOUS due to active credential harvesting. While it performs its stated function of generating tweet responses, it requires users to input their private OpenAI API key. Instead of communicating directly with OpenAI's official API (api.openai.com), the extension sends the user's secret key as a plaintext query parameter to a private server controlled by the developer (purplepanda.be). This practice allows the developer to collect and potentially misuse user API keys, which have direct financial value. There is no technical necessity to route secret API keys through a third-party proxy, and this behavior is not disclosed to the user.",
