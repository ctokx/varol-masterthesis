  "reasoning": "The extension is classified as malicious due to deceptive practices and unauthorized data exfiltration. While it markets itself as a 'Gemini AI Assistant' and opens the official Google Gemini page during installation to gain legitimacy, its core functionality involves scraping the full text of any page the user visits (via document.body.innerText) and sending it to an undisclosed third-party domain (talkai.info). This allows the third-party to ingest potentially sensitive data from any website the user browses, including private dashboards or logged-in sessions, without the user realizing the data is leaving Google's ecosystem.",
