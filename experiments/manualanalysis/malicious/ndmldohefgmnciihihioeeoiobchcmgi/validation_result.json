  "verdict": "MALICIOUS",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "The extension exhibits classic 'grayware' and malicious 'dual-purpose' behavior. While it provides the promised ChatGPT sidebar, it contains a significant hidden component for monetization through ad injection. This behavior is intentionally obscured by an 8-day execution delay (found in async.js), a technique commonly used to bypass automated security reviews in the Chrome Web Store. Once the 8-day window passes, the extension injects iframes from browsebetter.io, an entity associated with search hijacking and unauthorized ad delivery. The sidepanel.js file even updates the UI state to 'adon' (Ad On) once the frame loads successfully. This functionality is not disclosed in the manifest or description and serves the developer's financial interests at the cost of user privacy and browser performance.",

This calculates 8 days (691,200,000 ms) since installation. sidepanel.js defines injifr(): 'ifr.setAttribute(\"src\", \"https://s3.browsebetter.io/adfrnu2.html\");' which injects the ad frame into the side panel."
