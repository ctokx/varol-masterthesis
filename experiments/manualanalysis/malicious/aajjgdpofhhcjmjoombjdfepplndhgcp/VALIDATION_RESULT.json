While it does provide the AI interface in a side panel, it also injects a floating icon and a custom search bar onto every website the user visits (via all.js). User input in this injected search bar is redirected to 'srch.ing', a third-party domain used to monetize traffic. Furthermore, welcome.js silently loads a tracking pixel/iframe from 'eurekaa.app'. The use of Gemini branding is a lure to get users to install a tool that monitors browsing and hijacks search intent.",
