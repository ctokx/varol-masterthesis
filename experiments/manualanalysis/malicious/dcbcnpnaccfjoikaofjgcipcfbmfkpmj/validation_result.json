  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "The extension is a Trojanized variant of an AI assistant. While it contains functional code for translation and ChatGPT interaction, it includes a hardcoded Telegram Bot API credential. This token allows the extension to silently send data (stolen via the excessive Google Drive and Identity permissions) to the attacker's Telegram account. The presence of 'readaloud.app' code suggests the attacker repackaged a legitimate open-source extension and injected this malicious exfiltration logic into the large bundled files (options.js and popup.js).",
