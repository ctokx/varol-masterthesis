  "reasoning": "The extension is marked as SUSPICIOUS due to high-risk data handling and invasive behavior. First, it performs automated scraping of the user's entire Claude chat history by iteratively loading every chat URL in a background tab. While this supports the 'Search' feature, this level of automation is highly aggressive and indistinguishable from data harvesting. Second, the 'AI Assistant' feature exfiltrates user prompts and emails to a non-standard backend (a personal WordPress installation at test.mick.co.ke). This destination is not disclosed, and the use of 'admin-ajax.php' for processing sensitive AI prompts is a significant security and privacy risk. Third, there is a mismatch in permissions; the extension requests access to api.openai.com but actually routes data through the aforementioned third-party site. The code also contains developer comments ('REPLACE WITH YOUR DOMAIN') suggesting it may be a repurposed or poorly configured template.",
