  "reasoning": "The extension is classified as SUSPICIOUS primarily due to deceptive branding (claiming to be 'Chat GPT 5' to exploit OpenAI's brand) and its complex tracking/monetization infrastructure. It generates a persistent unique ID for the user and reports geolocation and versioning data to a custom backend (hub.malson.eu). While it performs its advertised tasks (AI chat/summarization), the inclusion of paywall management and financial 'withdraw-balances' endpoints in a utility extension suggests it may be part of a larger 'fleeceware' or tracking operation. The use of 'DeepSeek AI' in internal code vs 'Chat GPT 5' in public metadata further indicates white-labeling or repackaging of other services under a deceptive name.",
