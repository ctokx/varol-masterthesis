It claims to be an official 'Claude 3.5 Sonnet' extension (using Anthropic's branding) but is actually a wrapper for 'ext-access.pro'. It contains a significant amount of code for a third-party paywall system ('onlineapp.pro') which is not disclosed in its primary purpose. Most importantly, 'extension-bridge.js' allows the remote origin to request the user's current URL and page title, which is then exfiltrated to the developer's server. While not explicitly stealing credentials, the deceptive branding combined with context harvesting and a third-party billing engine are high-risk indicators of 'grayware' or a potentially unwanted application.",
