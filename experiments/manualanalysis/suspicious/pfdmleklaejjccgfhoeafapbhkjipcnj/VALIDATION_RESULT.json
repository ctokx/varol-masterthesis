  "reasoning": "The extension is classified as SUSPICIOUS because it performs high-risk security modifications that are disproportionate to its stated goal. Specifically, background.js implements a rule that removes 'X-Frame-Options' and 'Content-Security-Policy' headers for all websites the user visits. This is a common technique used by extensions to 'force' third-party websites into iframes or side panels, but it effectively disables critical browser protections against clickjacking and cross-site scripting (XSS) across the entire web. While there is no concrete evidence of data exfiltration or malicious C2 communication in the provided code, the global weakening of security posture is a significant red flag and a dangerous implementation choice. The core logic in injectDeepSeek.js correctly handles DOM manipulation for the intended purpose of automating chat inputs.",
