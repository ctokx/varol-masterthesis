It communicates with the background worker to send this text to OpenAI for summarization. The static analysis flagged a large number of URLs in worker.js, but inspection reveals these are string literals referring to model documentation, GitHub repositories, and API endpoints found within a bundled AI library (likely `transformers.js` or a generic AI client SDK), rather than malicious network calls. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, hidden functionality, or credential theft.",
