Static analysis findings that suggested broad network access (`https://*/*`) were found to be false positives related to Chrome API usage for tab and window management. However, a manual review of `background.js` revealed a hardcoded OpenAI API key. This is a critical security flaw that exposes the developer's private credentials.

The 'Export to PDF' functionality, a core feature, sends the user's complete ChatGPT conversation history to a third-party server (`www.gptaha.com`). This is implemented in `index.js` (line 266), where the conversation data is stringified and sent in the body of a POST request. Users would reasonably expect a 'save' or 'export' function to operate locally for privacy reasons. Instead, their potentially sensitive and private conversations are processed on an external server without their explicit consent, posing a significant privacy risk.

The extension implements a screenshot capture feature, which is a disclosed part of its functionality. Analysis of the code shows that captured screenshots are programmatically uploaded directly into the user's active ChatGPT session and are not sent to any undisclosed third-party servers. The static analysis finding of 'INTERCEPTION' and 'SECURITY_RISK' is highly likely a false positive, triggered by the complex and advanced DOM manipulation techniques used to make the screenshot upload feature work within the ChatGPT web application.
