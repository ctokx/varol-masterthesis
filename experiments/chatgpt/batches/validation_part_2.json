This component generates a persistent Unique User ID (UUID) by hashing the user's browser agent and extension details, and stores it in local storage.

This constitutes undisclosed user tracking. Additionally, static analysis identified network calls to other unrelated domains (`chatgpt4google.com`, `kodecoffee.com`) whose purpose is not clear from the provided code, adding to the suspicion.",
