While it provides the advertised ChatGPT wrapper, its primary background activity is a 'Green Mode' feature that performs silent affiliate link injection. It requests broad 'host_permissions' for all URLs (*/*) and uses 'tabs' access to monitor the user's browsing behavior in real-time. When a user visits a site matched in its partner list, it silently opens a hidden tab to the developer's affiliate URL, waits 2 seconds (long enough for the merchant to set a tracking cookie), and then closes the tab. This monetizes the user's browsing without clear disclosure of the affiliate mechanism, effectively performing cookie stuffing.",
