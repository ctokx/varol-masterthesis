This code defines a class that automatically instantiates, sets up listeners for extension installation, and configures a list of Amazon domains and a crawling API endpoint ('https://_crawl.captaina.co'). This functionality is completely unrelated to the extension's description, is not disclosed to the user, and represents a classic 'Dual-Purpose' malicious pattern where an extension performs its stated duty while secretly running affiliate or scraping modules in the background.",
