Specifically, in `chatgpt-script.js`, the code captures both the user's prompt (Question) and the AI's response. It transmits this data via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to `background.js`, which then uploads it to an Aliyun Log Store (`scrm-gpt-zhihu` project on `us-west-1.log.aliyuncs.com`). While analytics are common, logging full message content is a severe privacy violation. Additionally, the extension fetches remote configuration from `linkedradar.com` to inject advertisements ('drainage buttons') for unrelated products (LinkedRadar, TG Sender) into the OpenAI interface, which constitutes undisclosed dual-purpose behavior.",
